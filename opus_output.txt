All 12 tests pass and Pint formatting is clean. The SiteStar website is fully built. Here's a summary of everything that was created:

Home (/) — Hero with animated gradient text, floating background shapes & parallax, services section, featured portfolio preview, animated stats counters, and CTA
About (/about) — Company story, 6 principle cards with staggered reveal, technology stack with decorative code block
Portfolio (/portfolio) — Grid of project cards for dimgent.com and dimgent.by with hover overlay effects, tags, descriptions
Contact (/contact) — AJAX form with real-time validation, sticky sidebar with obfuscated contact info
Contact Form Security (5 layers):
Cloudflare Turnstile (invisible, configurable via TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY/TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY in .env)
Honeypot hidden field (website_url)
Rate limiting (throttle:5,1 — 5 requests/minute)
CSRF token (Laravel built-in)
Server-side validation via ContactFormRequest

Anti-Spam for Emails/Phones:

Mail Configuration:

Tests:

ContactFormTest — 6 tests covering success, validation, honeypot rejection, and rate limiting
The site is served by Laravel Herd and should be accessible. You may need to run npm run dev for hot-reload during development, or the build is already done and available.
